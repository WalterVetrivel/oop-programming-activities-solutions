# QUESTIONS & SOLUTIONS TO PROGRAMMING ACTIVITIES FOR THE COURSE - BE23GE310: OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING USING C++ FOR 1st YEAR B.E. CSE STUDENTS

Dear students,

Welcome to this repository. This is where I will publish sample solutions to the programming activities that I assign to you during the week. I'll usually publish solutions about 5 days to a week after publishing the question. You can find the sample code in the **Solutions** directory. The **Questions** directory just contains the same questions as I've provided you through GCR.

Please note that the solutions provided here are **samples** only - they are not meant to represent even necessarily the *best* solution, and they are far from being the *only* solution. The sample solutions are primarily meant to be a way for you to compare your approach to mine, and if you're stuck, to try and get an idea of how to approach a particular problem.

It is possible for you to find solutions that are **even better** than mine - *very few things give me more joy than seeing my students do better than me*, so, better, more creative, more optimal solutions are welcome, *especially* if you also understand why your solutions are better.

For those who might be struggling a little with understanding certain concepts - don't worry, I've added **extensive comments** to my solutions to help you understand the **underlying concepts** and for you to see why we are approaching each problem a certain way. *Please read through the comments to get a better understanding of the code*.

And for all students, please pay attention to the **formatting of the code** - the indentation, how I've split code into different blocks, how I've named my variables and functions, how I've added spacing between logical sections of the code, etc., - I'm not saying I'm the best at it, but I do believe I write readable code, so, make sure you're at least formatting your own code as well as mine if not better.

As I always say - the **best way to learn to code is by doing**, so, the **worst thing** you can do with the solutions shared here is to **just read them instead of trying out** the problems yourselves. So, don't do that, instead, at least try to replicate the solutions on your own even if you can't think of alternative approaches, but do try to find better ways of achieving the goal of each activity. And enjoy the process and *don't be scared to make mistakes* - by making mistakes, you can also learn what you shouldn't do.

As always, don't hesitate to reach out if you need any help. Happy coding!

Kind regards,
Walter
